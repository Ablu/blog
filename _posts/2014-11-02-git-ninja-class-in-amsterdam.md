Today we are very happy to announce that **we will bring our Git Ninja Class to Amsterdam** in the Netherlands! Join us for another exciting two-day workshop experience about the true power of the git version control system.

The workshop takes place at the 15th and 16th January 2015 in the wonderful rooms of [De Voorhoede](http://voorhoede.nl/).

Of course, this wouldn't be possible without a strong helping hand. With [De Voorhoede](http://voorhoede.nl/) we not only have a first class sponsor, but also a new friend to make future events possible. We are very happy and thankful being able to partner with people that are excited as we are.
