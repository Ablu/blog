If you've been following us for a while, you've probably noticed by now that we <3 to travel. Especially to run workshops and speak at tech events around the globe.

## Salt Lake City

Today we are excited to disclose that Pascal will fly over to the US to speak at [ng-conf](http://www.ng-conf.org/). It's the world's original Angular conference taking place on March 5th + 6th in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Pascal will co-present with [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) core team member [Chirayu](https://github.com/chirayuk). They'll be speaking about the new internationalization and localization support that is currently being worked on.

We are super happy about this and are very much looking forward to the event!


## Bangkok

Roughly a week ago Pascal and I talked about "The best Angular yet" at the [ng-nl](ng-nl.org) conference in Amsterdam. We are happy to share with you that we will bring this talk to Bangkok, Thailand on April 17th. I will present "The best Angular yet" alone since Pascal will be running a workshop in Switzerland then. Did I mention that we love traveling?

The talk will be given at the local Angular meetup in Bangkok. We're still busy to find the perfect location for the meetup so stay tuned for updates regarding the exact location and time.
